# Implementation Status and Documentation

The API does not currently cover all implemented services... we are working on it.

## Examples (test scenarios)

One of the best way to understand how a service is supposed to work and are the edge cases is to check the test scenarios for the services. These can be found in the [`*.feature` files](https://github.com/France-ioi/AlgoreaBackend/search?q=language%3AGherkin&unscoped_q=language%3AGherkin) in the code.

## Work in progress

The current status of the implementation of the services is currently kept on [Github](https://github.com/France-ioi/AlgoreaBackend/projects/1).

## Description of the services

The approximative partial specification of services to be implemented can be found in the ["server API details"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Xxmatrs_7my5ioriikL6YgOU4I0sAVcq5ySKinc0Nw/edit#) document. It is used as a base for developping future services.
