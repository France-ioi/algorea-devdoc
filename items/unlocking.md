# Item Unlocking

## FAQ / Remarks

### Team unlocking

If a team unlocks the access to an item, the permission granted is done to the team itself, not its member (<> what was done on AlgoreaPlaform). As a consequence, a member leaving a team may lose access to this content, and a member joining the team after the unlock may gain access. It insures that all team members have the same access to content during a contest.
