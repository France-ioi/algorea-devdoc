# Backend services

## API

There is currently no API for the backend services. The best way to use the backend is to use the descriptions of the services (see below) to know what exists and read the [`*.feature` files](https://github.com/France-ioi/AlgoreaBackend/search?q=language%3AGherkin&unscoped_q=language%3AGherkin) in the code for usage examples.

## Work in progress

The current status of the implementation of the services is currently kept on [Github](https://github.com/France-ioi/AlgoreaBackend/projects/1).

## Description of the services

The approximative partial specification of services to be implemented can be found in the ["server API details"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Xxmatrs_7my5ioriikL6YgOU4I0sAVcq5ySKinc0Nw/edit#) document. It is used as a base for developping future services.
