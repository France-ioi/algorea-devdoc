# Forum

What is called the "forum" in the context of Algorea is set of discussion *threads*, each one related to a content and a participant (i.e., a user or a team). It is a way (currently) for a user to ask for help on a task (more usage to come).

On the backend side, it runs both on the `serverless` framework (using AWS lambda, DynamoDB and Websockets) and the algorea backend (Go + MySQL).
