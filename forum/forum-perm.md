# Forum Permissions

In a nutshell:
- a user requires a specific permission to open a thread
- a user with observation permissions (on item and participant) can view, open and answer threads
- other users may be allowed to view and answer threads on some conditions

## Specific permission

In order to open a thread for an item, a user needs a specific item permission: "can request help to" which allows the user to request help to a given group for an item and its descendants depending on propagation rules.

### Propagation

This permission propagates as the other item permissions with a specific `help_request_propagation` boolean property on `items_items`, which behaves as the other propagation rules. The propagation of the permissions through items is not pre-computed (it cannot be as the `group` parameter could not be).

### Changing and propagating permissions

Constraint on receiver: none

Constraint on giver: requires "can_grant_view â‰¥ content"

### In practice

In practice, in order to verify that the user `U` "can request help to" a group `G` on an item `I` we need to verify whether one of the ancestors (including himself) of `U` has the `can_request_help_to(g)` on `I`, recursively on `I`'s ancestors while `help_request_propagation=1`, for `G` being a descendant of `g`.

## Writing in a thread

In order to write in a thread, the **thread needs to be opened** and the user needs to either:
- be the participant of the thread
- have `can_watch>=answer` permission on the item AND `can_watch_members` on the participant
- be part of the group the participant has requested help to AND either have `can_watch>=answer` on the item OR have `validated` the item.

## Listing / reading a thread

In order to have a thread listed and be able to view it (in read-only if not authorized to write), the user needs to be allowed to view the item AND match one of these conditions:
- be the participant of the thread
- have `can_watch>=answer` permission on the item
- be part of the group the participant has requested help to, AND the thread is either open or closed for less than 2 weeks, AND ~~either the user has `can_watch>=answer` on the item OR (duplicate from previous rule)~~ the user has `validated` the item

## Changing the status of a thread

- The **participant of a thread** can always switch the thread from open to any another other status. He can only switch it from not-open to an open status if he is allowed to request help on this item (see "specific permission" above)
- A user who has `can_watch>=answer` on the item AND `can_watch_members` on the participant: can always switch a thread to any open status (i.e. he can always open it but not close it)
- A user who can write on the thread can switch from an open status to another open status.
